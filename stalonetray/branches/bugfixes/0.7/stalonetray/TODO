+ Each icon must have a newly created parent window, which matches its
  dimentions (for ease of move and for them to be centered ?). 
+ Anvanced grow
+ Reorganize settings (and vars)  
- Make use of resources (WONTDO)
+ rc file
+ Need to handle unusual sizes of "icons" (and resolve when to force
  constraints)
+ Make satray survive even if window suddenly dissapears
  (during some operation, when destroy\unmap was not handled)
+ KDE tray implementation (solves previous problem)
+ Handle tray icon move/resize
+ Simplify rc file syntax/re-reorganize settings
+ main.c cleanup 
+ update transparent/parent background on icon move/resize
+ review DBG() calls in accordance with doc/DEBUG-LEVELS
+ reacquire tray selection after loss (if holder exits) (update sample rc(done))
+ find and fix typos
+ fix (almost all) warnings with -Wall
+ .spec file for building rpms
+ man page
+ tray grow with wnd deco

for 0.4
+ default values in the manpage, MWM/EWMH compliancy must be noted
+ ontop/onbottom/normal (wnd_layer param)
+ xorg7 build troubles
+ more flexible wnd deco specification
+ make use of ewmh spec (_NET_WM_STATE_SKIP_PAGER, _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DOCK and friends)
+ all configure.in needs review (refuse to build if something goes wrong)
+ update DBG so that it does not require C99
+ *wm tests (pwm(2), e17 have some issues):
	+ WMaker (everything works)
	+ Fvwm (for sure)
	+ PWM(1) (no_{title,border} do not work)
	+ E17 (the same =()
+ something has happened to vertical layout (all works)
+ tests on sf cf
	+ now stalonetray can be build with Sun ONE 8 C compiler =) (because it's sources conform to C90 specs)
+ change status to beta =)


for 0.5(unreleased, renamed to 0.6)
+ code cleanup (again :() (REVIEW layout.c very thoroughly!!!)
+ fix geometry issues
+ GNUisms in debug.h
+ icons are not aligned properly inside their mid-parents
+ basename can be either in libgen.h or in string.h o_O : XPG ver from libgen.h was chosen
+ update manpages, etc (docbook for documentation ?)
+ fix default rc file name
+ backtrace in configure.in is not detected ?
+ make boolean cfg file opts to have _optional_ argument
+ make permanent behaviour default and remove it from configuration
+ default values in documentation
+ validate stalonetray.xml
+ collect icons on startup (test, KDE icons issue) needs XEMBED ?!!!
+ Full XEMBED implementation (?)
+ issue with composite extension on (seq1,2)
+ version info
+ pixmap bg
+ check rc keyword names for concistency and update stalonetrayrc.sample
+ test non-debug version
+ test with LARGE pixmap
+ PORTING
+ fix the website for IE (and colors)

for 0.7
- DOXYGEN documentation (WONTDO, 0.8?)
- one state instead of multiple flags for icons (WONTDO)
- split main.c into: signals.c events.c main.c (WONTDO)
- support for WINE icons (WONTDO: isn't it WINE problem?)
+ consistent naming scheme for funcs
+ shrink back mode
+ reconsider API
+ improve X11-using code
+ params for boolean cmd line parameters (reconsider cmd line params and rc file directives) ??? (--skip-taskbar=true)
+ indicate parsing errors (make them fatal?)
+ comments
+ bg tinting (with fade out)
+ wmaker mode (SORTOFWORKS)
+ fall back to legacy KDE icons handling scheme when list of icons is not available
+ withdrawn mode should be configurable
+ XEMBED test suite ?
+ rethink command line params names
+ merge changes from 0.6 bugfixes branch (x86_64 patches pending) (size hints handling?)
+ layout _needs_ fixin` (TEST!!!!, seq1) (HOORAY!!!!!)
+ automatic version string in _all_ documentation
+ update README/docs
+ sanitize DBG levels

for 0.7.6
+ ensure that x11_ok() called at all exit paths from x11-calling functions
+ startup issues (collect existing icons)
- focus issue in Wmaker

for 0.7.7
- track size changes of the icons that failed to fit into the tray?
- profile the code 
- valgrind
- sanitize x11 calls: check return values instead of relying on x11_ok() whenever possible
